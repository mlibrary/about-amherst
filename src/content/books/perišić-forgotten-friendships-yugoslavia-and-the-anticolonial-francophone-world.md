description: "Forgotten Friendships: Yugoslavia and the Anticolonial Francophone
  World examines transnational friendships and alliances between intellectuals
  from Yugoslavia and the Francophone African and Caribbean world during the
  mid-twentieth century. The book argues that transnational political
  friendships helped shape major intellectual movements like Négritude, African
  socialism, and global socialist feminisms, which surged beyond national,
  regional, and even diasporic spaces."
