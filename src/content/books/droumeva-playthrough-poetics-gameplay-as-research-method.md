description: Game streamers and live commentators are producing increasingly
  comprehensive analyses of gameplay, yet scholarship still tends to flatten the
  experiential media of video games into text for close reading. By shifting
  focus toward the immersiveness of video games, Playthrough Poetics makes the
  case for gameplay as a necessary, alternate method. Contributors to this
  volume engage widely with the activity of play through autoethnographies,
  meta-analyses of self-broadcasting, new procedural methods like gamespace
  soundwalking, as well as the affective aspects of games research. In doing so,
  they model new possibilities for academic players and gamers alike.
