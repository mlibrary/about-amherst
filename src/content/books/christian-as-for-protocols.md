description: Explicitly—or not—protocols determine much of what we do. Far
  exceeding traditional notions of “good manners,” protocols are systems of
  language that regulate how we relate to each other, to our cultural, social,
  and political environments, and to the technologies that create them. The
  first publication to critically examine protocols across a wide range of
  disciplines, As for Protocols brings together contributions by twenty-four
  international artists, writers, scholars, musicians, architects, and
  scientists who explore protocols across various fields, foregrounding
  opportunities for creating new protocols that are inclusive and equitable.
