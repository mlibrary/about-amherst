description: "Media Travels: Toward An Atlas of Global Media fills a significant
  gap in global media scholarship by offering short, readable articles covering
  different types of media from around the world. Through careful and informed
  analysis, these eleven accessibly written chapters illustrate the
  particularities of different media practices and situate them within social,
  historical, and geographical contexts. Examples range from South African video
  games to Korean TV series popular in Latin America to Indigenous film and
  media from the US and Canada."
