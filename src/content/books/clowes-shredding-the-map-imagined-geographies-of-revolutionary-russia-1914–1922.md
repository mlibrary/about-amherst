description: Shredding the Map investigates Russian place consciousness in the
  decade between the start of World War I and the end of the Russian civil war.
  Attachment to place is a vital aspect of human identity, and connection to
  homeland, whether imagined or real, can be especially powerful. Drawing from a
  large digital database of period literature, Shredding the Map investigates
  the metamorphic changes in how Russians related to places—whether abstractions
  like “country” or concrete spaces of borders, fronts, and edgelands—during
  these years.
