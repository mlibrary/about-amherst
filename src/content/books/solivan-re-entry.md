description: Re-entry is acclaimed musician Marianne Solivan’s fifth jazz album.
  Working with a group of musicians including Leandro Pellegrino (guitar), Steve
  Wood (bass), Jay Sawyer (drums) and Alex Terrier (saxophones) over the early
  years of the COVID-19 pandemic, Solivan first rehearsed a varied repertoire in
  an empty neighborhood bar, recording just as New York City was coming out of
  lockdown. In her words, “Everyone brought in music they loved, and we all
  jumped in on every song. Arrangements were shaped and reshaped until we all
  felt they were right. We had no allegiances to style or genre but only to our
  own musicianship and musicality.”
