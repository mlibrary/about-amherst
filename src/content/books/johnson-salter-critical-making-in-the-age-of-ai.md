description: Critical Making in the Age of AI invites students, teachers,
  learners, and digital humanists to explore making as scholarship. Inspired by
  the craft traditions of textile arts, this book combines a survey of forms of
  alternative scholarly communication—such as comics, GIFs, maps, games, and
  generative AI—and a pattern book, where patterns serve as starting points that
  makers can reimagine and remix.
