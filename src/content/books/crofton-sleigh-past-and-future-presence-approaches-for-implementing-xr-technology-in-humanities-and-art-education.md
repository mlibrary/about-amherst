description: While uses and studies of XR technology within STEM-based education
  have been plentiful in recent years, there has been lesser or even, at times,
  a lack of coverage for this novel learning tool in the arts and humanities.
  Past and Future Presence aims to bridge some of that gap by presenting
  research-based theory and case studies of successful application and
  implementation of XR technology into postsecondary educational settings,
  ranging in topics from ancient to modern languages, classical and contemporary
  art, and reenvisioned historical scenes and events presented in ways never
  seen before.
