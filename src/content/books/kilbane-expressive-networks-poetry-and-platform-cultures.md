description: "Expressive Networks convenes an urgent conversation on digital
  media and the social life of contemporary poetry. Tracing how poems circulate
  through online spaces and how capitalized platforms have come to pattern the
  reading and writing of poetry, contributors emphasize both the expressivist
  cast of digital literary culture and the deep-running ambivalence that
  characterizes aesthetic and critical responses to platformed cultural
  production. "
