title: "Beyond Mestizaje: Contemporary Debates on Race in Mexico"
authorLastname: Islas Weinstein
author: Tania Islas Weinstein, Milena Ang and Ellen Jones
cover: assets/weinstein_cover_front.jpg
description: "Racism has historically been a taboo topic in Mexico. This is
  largely due to the nationalist project of mestizaje which contends that
  because all Mexicans are racially mixed, race is not a salient political
  issue. In recent years, however, race and racism have become important topics
  of debate in the countryâ€™s public sphere and academia. This book introduces
  readers to a sample of these diverse and sometimes conflicting views that also
  intersect with discussions of class. "
