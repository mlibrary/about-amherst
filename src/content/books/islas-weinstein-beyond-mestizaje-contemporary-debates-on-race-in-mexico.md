description: Racism has historically been a taboo topic in Mexico. This is
  largely due to the nationalist project of mestizaje which contends that
  because all Mexicans are racially mixed, race is not a salient political
  issue. In recent years, however, race and racism have become important topics
  of debate in the countryâ€™s public sphere and academia. This book introduces
  readers to a sample of these diverse and sometimes conflicting views that also
  intersect with discussions of class. The activists and scholars included in
  the volume come from fields such as anthropology, linguistics, history,
  sociology, and political science. Through these diverse epistemological
  frameworks, the authors show how people in contemporary Mexico interpret the
  world in racial terms and denounce racism.
