  rooted in interviews with religious leaders, musicians, and activists across
  Brazil. This multidisciplinary exploration examines the relentless attacks
  against the practitioners of Afro-Brazilian religionsâ€”from discriminatory
  noise complaints in Bahia to vigilante violence in Rio de Janeiro.
