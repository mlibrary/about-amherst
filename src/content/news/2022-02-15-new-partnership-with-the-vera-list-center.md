Amherst College Press and the Vera List Center for Art and Politics at The New School are pleased to announce a publishing partnership launching in 2022. The partnership will further each institution’s commitment to advancing the understanding of the intersection of art and politics and combine their extensive networks, centering exciting contemporary publishing on art and politics in an international discourse. All titles under this imprint will be available in print and, for free, digitally, thus opening the important research of both institutions to an entirely new generation of scholars and readers throughout the world.

The Vera List Center for Art and Politics is a research center and a public forum for public scholarship on art, culture, and politics. It was established at The New School in 1992, and is now known for its dynamic interdisciplinary public programs, conferences, artist fellowships and residencies, and the Jane Lombard Prize for Art and Social Justice, as well as exhibitions and publications that build solidarity, expand knowledge, and spark social and political empowerment through art.

Amherst College Press’s Spring 2022 catalog will announce the Vera List Center’s first publication through their new partnership, *Studies into Darkness: The Perils and Promise of Freedom of Speech*. Edited by VLC’s Carin Kuoni and independent writer and curator Laura Raicovich, *Studies into Darkness* emerged from a series of seminars guided by acclaimed artist, filmmaker, and activist Amar Kanwar at the Vera List Center for Art and Politics at The New School.
