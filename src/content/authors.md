## Areas of Interest

ACP publishes titles in art history and visual studies; digital and game studies; Latin American studies; literary and media studies; music and sound studies; and Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies. We also have deep interests in activist studies, environmental and energy humanities, multilingualism and translation, public and community humanities, and all forms of justice-oriented scholarship and methodology.

Our publishing program is aligned with the ethos of the liberal arts and deeply committed to accessibility. All our books are fully peer reviewed, expertly copyedited, and well designed; everything we publish is made available both as open-access, freely downloadable ebooks and pdf files as well as affordable paperbacks . Amherst College covers the cost of the open-access edition, so there are no fees or charges to authors or their institutions.

Amherst College Press partners with [Fulcrum](https://www.fulcrum.org/), the digital publishing platform of Michigan Publishing Services, to produce our books. Fulcrum treats all forms of digital objects equally, which means we have the ability to integrate things like images, video, visualizations, and sound into ebooks in interesting ways. Michigan Publishing Services assures that our titles are discoverable by, and accessible to, the widest possible audience, while being sustainable into the digital future.
