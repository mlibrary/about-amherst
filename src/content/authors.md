## The Amherst College Press Editorial Program

We seek works that fit into either or both of these broad categories:

***Topics, fields, and communities that would benefit from open access books.*** Smaller fields—particularly emerging fields and subfields—can encounter difficulty finding a pathway to publication in market-based publishing. We’re especially interested in receiving proposals from scholars in such fields, and from those whose work engages and speaks to reading and scholarly communities typically underserved by traditional publishing models.

***Fields better served by digital platforms for the communication of ideas.*** As a press focused on the creation of digital-first work, we are interested in proposals utilizing digital technologies to convey ideas and modes of inquiry in the humanities implementing technology in new and creative ways. Our works are published on[ Fulcrum](https://www.fulcrum.org/), which provides a platform allowing narrative to be richly integrated with associated data (images, videos, audio files, visualizations, etc.), optimized for long-term preservation and accessibility.

## Existing series

#### *Electronic Communities of Making*

*S*eries Editors: Anastasia Salter, University of Central Florida & Stuart Moulthrop, University of Wisconsin, Madison

Electronic Communities of Making promotes thoughtful reflection on the communities and practices driving electronic creativity by publishing works that reach across electronic literature, game studies, and internet research to explore the intersection of theory, practice, and pedagogy. We particularly hope to encourage engagement with open-source tools that invite and encourage inclusive making: from established platforms for interactive fiction, to alternative games platforms redefining play, to artistic communities shaping procedural expression.

#### *Law, Literature & Culture*

*S*eries Editor: Austin Sarat, Amherst College

Editorial Board: Peter Brooks, Princeton University; Susan Sage Heinzelman, University of Texas, Austin; Bernadette Meyler, Stanford University; Ravit Reichman, Brown University; Eric Slauter, University of Chicago

Law and literature have for millennia been closely allied as means of persuasion and the creation of cultural norms. This series sets law, literature, and culture in new dialogues, exploring the textual dimensions and cultural work of law and the legal frameworks of literature. We seek work that brings literary, legal, and/or cultural analysis together to explore specific social and political problems and that attends carefully to historical contexts and issues. Of particular interest are works that define and argue a thesis drawing on both textual and non-textual sources for which a multimodal, digital presentation offers unique expressive power.

#### *Mammoth Records*

Series Editor: Darryl Harper, Amherst College

Editors: Xavier Davis, Michigan State University; Eric Oberstein, Duke University

Mammoth Records is an academic record label focusing on new jazz recordings. In music today, the means of production are increasingly accessible yet distribution has become tightly controlled by a few actors. Mammoth Records employs the structure of open access scholarly publishing to rectify the music industry’s neglect of “new knowledge” by utilizing digital formats, peer review as a collaborative process, and limited distribution rights associated with Creative Commons licensing. The series models a commitment to the liberal arts by cultivating discovery through analysis, interpretation, and connecting ideas across disciplines.

#### *Music & Material Encounters*

Series Editors: Amy Coddington, Amherst College & Jake Johnson, Oklahoma City University

This series publishes long-form essays and traditional monographs that examine music and materiality. Projects in this series may draw upon music’s intersections with print, visual art, and architecture; musical practices of embodiment through studies of anatomy or choreography; and music’s interactions with legal and militaristic policies throughout the world. Authors are encouraged to consider how music and musical practices develop alongside the various media they encounter, and how their scholarship itself engages with the materiality of this media.

#### *Public Works*

*S*eries Editor: Austin Sarat, Amherst College

Public Works seeks out and makes available the perspective of leading scholars in the humanities and humanistic social sciences on emergent questions that have long-term significance in our public conversations. Shorter than monographs, these works offer the freedom of long-form essays and the tools of digital media.

#### *Russian Travelogues*

Series Editor: Sergey Glebov, Smith College & Amherst College

Russian Travelogues introduces to the English-speaking world narratives of exploration, travel, and conquest produced by representatives of the military, missionary, and scholarly communities in imperial Russia. “These travelogues represent a very helpful contribution to bringing the imperial turn into the classroom and broader scholarly discussion. They provide a revealing entree into problems of empire, difference, hierarchical relations, and other complexes of ideas and practices that characterized nineteenth-century approaches to rulership… at the same time, scholars working on that period of European imperial history will find their own avenue into a more broadly comparative approach” - David McDonald, University of Wisconsin, Madison

#### *Video Game Art Reader*

Series Editor: Tiffany Funk, University of Illinois, Chicago & Video Game Art Gallery; Managing Editor: Michael Reed, Video Game Art Gallery

The Video Game Art Reader (VGAR) is a peer-reviewed annual series for video game audiences and video game practitioners interested in the history, theory, and criticism of video games, explored through the lens of art history and visual culture. We seek to advocate for video games as art and to create an inclusive, multivalent, diversified conversation about the past, present, and possible futures of video games. The Video Game Art Reader's editorial board comprises artists, scholars, and video game enthusiasts from cultural and educational institutions throughout the United States.

## Areas of Interest

The press publishes titles in Art History and Visual Studies, Latin American Studies, Literary Studies, Music, and Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies with a deep interest in interdisciplinary scholarship.
