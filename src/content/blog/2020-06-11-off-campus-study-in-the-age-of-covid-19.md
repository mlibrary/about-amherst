## New Titles

We’re excited to announce our newest title is live: read Carlos Alberto Sánchez’s [*A Sense of Brutality: Philosophy after Narco-Culture* here](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.11923978%20). Sánchez will be in conversation with ACP author James Martel on Wednesday, October 21 as part of the salon series at the Amherst College [Center for Humanistic Inquiry](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/colloquia/center-humanistic-inquiry).

Egor Kovalevsky’s *A Journey to Inner Africa* (translated by Anna Aslanyan), the first in our Russian Travelogue series edited by Sergey Glebov, is due out later this fall. And Marta Werner’s *Writing in Time: Emily Dickinson's Master Hours*will be available winter 2021.

Forthcoming titles from ACP include a groundbreaking collection of essays on public history, *Radical Roots: Public History and Social Justice* (ed. Denise Meringolo); a timely and accessible edited volume on *Public Scholarship in Literary Studies* (eds. Rachel Arteaga and Rosemary Johnsen); *The Border of Lights Reader: Bearing Witness to Genocide in the Dominican Republic* (eds. Megan Myers and Edward Paulino), an innovative anthology on the Border of Lights collective; and *Twining: Critical and Creative Approaches to Hypertext Narratives* by Anastasia Salter and Stuart Moulthrop, one of the only books on the digital-storytelling tool Twine.

## Distributed Title

ACP is proud to distribute *Amherst in the World* (ed. Martha Saxton). The book gathers scholars and writers to reflect on the history of Amherst College, in celebration of its 200th year. [Read it online here](https://www.fulcrum.org/concern/monographs/6q182m93x?locale=en).

## From the ACP Interns

James Martel spoke with our Greg Call summer intern, Joy Won (‘23), about his book *[Unburied Bodies: Subversive Corpses and the Authority of the Dead](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10214671)* (ACP, 2018). Of the victims of police murder including George Floyd, Michael Brown, Sandra Bland, Trayvon Martin, and too many others, Martel said: “I think they’re all working together right now to fight white supremacy, and I really do think it speaks to the agency of the dead and how powerful an effect they have on the living in a positive way.”

As part of her internship, Joy wrote a series of blog posts about ACP and what open access scholarship means to undergraduates. According to Joy: “The ACP embodies our school motto Terras Irradientor ‘Let them give light to the world’as is seen by the work and objectives the press upholds and stands for.”

Our spring intern, Jaclyn Chetty (‘20), followed the Internet Archive’s “National Emergency Library.” Jaclyn’s post--written in the midst of college shut-downs and stay-at-home-orders and as the Internet Archive faced legal action--captures the arguments for and against the Library as a controversial instance of “open access.” Ultimately, as Jaclyn shows, “OA’s mission to provide access to literature and scholarly work to the masses is one that has existed long before the global pandemic began, and is one that was built with a sustainable, legal model free of copyright infringement and therefore able to stand the test of time--and lawsuits.”

Jaclyn’s and Joy’s posts will be available along with other resources and content created by ACP interns on our new website, debuting fall 2020.

We’ve also launched an Instagram account! Follow us [@amherstcollegepress](https://www.instagram.com/amherstcollegepress/) for open access booklists, news, and events.

As fall semester begins, we wave good-bye to Jaclyn and Joy and welcome new ACP interns Angel Musyimi (‘23) and Sydney Ireland (‘23) to our team. All of us at the press hope you can join conversations being had in the OA publishing world whether via virtual conferences, Zoom meetings, Twitter, Instagram, or elsewhere. **Stay in touch. And above all, be well.**
