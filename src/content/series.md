<h2 id="acp-records"><cite>ACP Records</cite></h2>

Series Editor: Darryl Harper, Amherst College

Advisory Board: Regina Carter, Violinist & MacArthur Fellow; Xavier Davis, Michigan State University; Tom Welsh, Managing Director, Big Ears Festival

ACP Records is an academic record label focusing on new jazz recordings. In music today, the means of production are increasingly accessible yet distribution has become tightly controlled by a few actors. ACP Records employs the structure of open access scholarly publishing to rectify the music industry’s neglect of “new knowledge” by utilizing digital formats, peer review as a collaborative process, and limited distribution rights associated with Creative Commons licensing. The series models a commitment to the liberal arts by cultivating discovery through analysis, interpretation, and connecting ideas across disciplines.

<h2 id="electronic-communities-of-making"><cite>Electronic Communities of Making</cite></h2>

Series Editors: Anastasia Salter, University of Central Florida & Stuart Moulthrop, University of Wisconsin, Madison

Electronic Communities of Making promotes thoughtful reflection on the communities and practices driving electronic creativity by publishing works that reach across electronic literature, game studies, and internet research to explore the intersection of theory, practice, and pedagogy. We particularly hope to encourage engagement with open-source tools that invite and encourage inclusive making: from established platforms for interactive fiction, to alternative games platforms redefining play, to artistic communities shaping procedural expression.

<h2 id="emergent-ideas"><cite>Emergent Ideas: Lateral Books in Cultural Studies</cite></h2>

Series Editors: Robert Carley, Texas A&M University; Anne Donlon, Independent Scholar; Eero Laine, University at Buffalo, State University of New York; SAJ, New York University; Chris Alen Sula, Pratt Institute

Emergent Ideas: Lateral Books in Cultural Studies publishes concise analyses and interpretations of contemporary and emergent cultural phenomena. Titles in the series explore the objects, events, artifacts, and practices that shape and structure communities, politics, and movements. We are especially interested in work that explores cultural phenomena and ideas on the cusp of articulation: the beginnings of a new theory, for example, or the identification of meanings, relations, and practices that are constitutive of a cultural moment or movement. We invite sharp, speculative, and radically novel analyses, critiques, and theories between 15,000 and 40,000 words that advance interdisciplinary conversations across the field of cultural studies internationally.

<h2 id="law-literature-culture"><cite>Law, Literature & Culture</cite></h2>

Series Editor: Austin Sarat, Amherst College

Advisory Board: Peter Brooks, Princeton University; Susan Sage Heinzelman, University of Texas, Austin; Bernadette Meyler, Stanford University; Ravit Reichman, Brown University; Eric Slauter, University of Chicago

Law and literature have for millennia been closely allied as means of persuasion and the creation of cultural norms. This series sets law, literature, and culture in new dialogues, exploring the textual dimensions and cultural work of law and the legal frameworks of literature. We seek work that brings literary, legal, and/or cultural analysis together to explore specific social and political problems and that attends carefully to historical contexts and issues. Of particular interest are works that define and argue a thesis drawing on both textual and non-textual sources for which a multimodal, digital presentation offers unique expressive power.

<h2 id="Music & Material Encounters"><cite>Music & Material Encounters</cite></h2>

Series Editors: Amy Coddington, Amherst College & Jake Johnson, Oklahoma City University

This series publishes long-form essays and traditional monographs that examine music and materiality. Projects in this series may draw upon music’s intersections with print, visual art, and architecture; musical practices of embodiment through studies of anatomy or choreography; and music’s interactions with legal and militaristic policies throughout the world. Authors are encouraged to consider how music and musical practices develop alongside the various media they encounter, and how their scholarship itself engages with the materiality of this media.

<h2 id="public-works"><cite>Public Works</cite></h2>

Series Editor: Austin Sarat, Amherst College

Public Works seeks out and makes available the perspective of leading scholars in the humanities and humanistic social sciences on emergent questions that have long-term significance in our public conversations. Shorter than monographs, these works offer the freedom of long-form essays and the tools of digital media.

<h2 id="re/verse"><cite>Re/verse</cite></h2>

Series editors: Brian Glavey, University of South Carolina; Kamran Javadizadeh, Villanova University; Johanna Winant, West Virginia University

Re/verse is a series of compact introductions to individual books of poetry. Poems are often understood in relation to their canonization in anthologies and *Collected Works*, or, more recently, through forms of viral circulation on social media and other digital platforms. Re/verse proposes that the poetry collection itself is a significant unit of meaning and that studying a collection brings new insights to our reading of the poems it contains. These short, accessibly-written books will appeal to nonacademic readers and writers as well as teachers and students in literary studies and creative writing classes.

<h2 id="russian-travelogues"><cite>Russian Travelogues</cite></h2>

Series Editor: Sergey Glebov, Smith College & Amherst College

Russian Travelogues introduces to the English-speaking world narratives of exploration, travel, and conquest produced by representatives of the military, missionary, and scholarly communities in imperial Russia. “These travelogues represent a very helpful contribution to bringing the imperial turn into the classroom and broader scholarly discussion. They provide a revealing entree into problems of empire, difference, hierarchical relations, and other complexes of ideas and practices that characterized nineteenth-century approaches to rulership… at the same time, scholars working on that period of European imperial history will find their own avenue into a more broadly comparative approach” - David McDonald, University of Wisconsin, Madison

<h2 id="Urgent-Knowledges"><cite>Urgent Knowledges</cite></h2>

Series Editor: Paul Schroeder Rodríguez

Advisory Board: Emil' Keme, Emory University & Christen Smith, Yale University

Urgent Knowledges is a translation series that highlights Indigenous, Afro-descendant, and similarly marginalized intellectual traditions in the geocultural area known as Latin America, including the Caribbean. We actively seek proposals for translations of works and bilingual editions that explore timely and pressing matters such as the climate crisis, forms of inequality, and responses to extractivism. The series will consider texts from a variety of periods and genres, in both fiction and nonfiction, that center concepts and practices such as *suma qamaña* (Aymara for ‘convivial living’) and *ubuntu* (Nguni for ‘I am because we are’). Urgent Knowledges will thus amplify voices that offer an expansive horizon of living in harmony with oneself, with other human and non-human beings, and with the diverse ecosystems that sustain us all. 

<h2 id="The vera-list-center-for-art-and-politics"><cite>The Vera List Center for Art and Politics</cite></h2>

The Vera List Center for Art and Politics is a research center and a public forum for public scholarship on art, culture, and politics. Their publishing partnership with ACP will further each institution’s commitment to advancing the understanding of the intersection of art and politics and center exciting contemporary publishing on art and politics in an international discourse. All titles will be available in print and as open access works.

<h2 id="video-game-art-reader"><cite>Video Game Art Reader</cite></h2>

Series Editor: Tiffany Funk, University of Illinois, Chicago & Video Game Art Gallery

The Video Game Art Reader (VGAR) is a peer-reviewed annual series for video game audiences and video game practitioners interested in the history, theory, and criticism of video games, explored through the lens of art history and visual culture. We seek to advocate for video games as art and to create an inclusive, multivalent, diversified conversation about the past, present, and possible futures of video games. The Video Game Art Reader's editorial board comprises artists, scholars, and video game enthusiasts from cultural and educational institutions throughout the United States.
