Amherst College Press participates in the life and community at Amherst College and the greater Pioneer Valley in many ways. We are always eager to partner with organizations, community groups, and colleagues at other academic and public libraries. Reach out to us if you would like to learn more about open access humanities book publishing, to request a publishing workshop on your campus, or to simply say hi. 

Read more about the Amherst College internship program here; we are working to develop more opportunities for Amherst College undergraduates to become involved in the work of the press.

Below find resources created by our interns: blog posts, book lists, author interviews, and more.
