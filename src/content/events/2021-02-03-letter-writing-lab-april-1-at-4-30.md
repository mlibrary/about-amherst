Join us in celebrating the publication of Marta Werner's new edition of Emily Dickinson's "Master Letters" by writing your own letters to the world. Amherst faculty member Benigno Sanchez Eppler will be joined by archivist Rachel Jirka to introduce key concepts in the history of epistolarity and the material life of letters. Pick up your own postcard designed by ACP interns from Frost library, sharpen your pencils, uncap your pens, and get ready to write. Co-hosted by the Frost Library Programming Committee. Details to be announced in the Daily Mammoth.
