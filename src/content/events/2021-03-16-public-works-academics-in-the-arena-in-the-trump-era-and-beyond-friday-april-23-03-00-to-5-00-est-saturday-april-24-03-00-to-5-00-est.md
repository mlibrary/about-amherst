This two-day conference will explore and assess the work of academics who responded to the Trump years by writing commentary and opinion pieces for public audiences. Together, panelists will examine the motives that led scholars to take on this role in their work, reflect on the work they have done as well as discusss what they might do in the near future. We will also consider lessons learned about writing for a public audience and hte place of the public intellectual in today's academy. Presenters include Austin Sarat (Amherst), Nadia Brown (Purdue), Bernadette Meylar (Stanford), Elizabeth Cobbs (Texas A&M), Jason Stanley (Yale) and others. Commentary by Jill Lawrence of USA Today and Beth Daly from The Conversation.
