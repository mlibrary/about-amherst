ACP had a booth at this year's ASEEES, where we greeted several ACP authors and contributors to edited volumes, and held a reception and raffle on Friday evening. ACP joined with ASEEES in honoring Dr. Edith W. Clowes, Brown-Forman Chair Emerita in the Humanities in the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures at the University of Virginia, as recipient of the 2025 ASEEES Distinguished Contributions Award.
